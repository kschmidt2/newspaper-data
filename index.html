          <p>You would be hard-pressed to find someone who isn’t aware of the declining state of the newspaper industry in the United States. Since newspaper revenues began falling dramatically in the early 2000s as a result of the Internet boom, there has been extensive coverage of declining revenues and dwindling newsrooms. According to <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/state-of-the-news-media-2016/">Pew Research Center’s State of the News Media</a>, advertising revenue at publically-traded newspaper companies was down 7.8% in 2016 and nationwide newspaper employment was down to 32,900, from a high of over 56,000 in 2000.</p>
          <p>Community newspapers provide much of the news that supports democracy at the state and local levels, linking the fate of a community with the fate of its newspaper. Thus, smaller communities that lack other news sources suffer most when a newspaper decreases its coverage of local affairs or shuts down altogether. Meanwhile, those in larger cities have fewer choices for getting local news after smaller papers succomb to competition from larger ones.</p>
          <p>The decline in readership and advertising and the corresponding loss in revenue has hit newspapers in every part of the country, but the greatest loss has been in the big cities. Newspapers in major metropolitian areas have seen a larger portion of their readership vanish, which papers in rural areas have had more success hanging on to readers who may not have other options. Scroll down to see the data on how the newspaper industry has been affected in different areas of the country.</p>

While rural papers don't dominate in influence, they rule in numbers. Many of the rural papers in the United States are weeklies with small circulation. The uptick in minor metro newspapers is likely due to demographic shifts rather than an increase in number of papers.</p>
